# photometric-pipeline
To facilitate my research, I built a Python tool that cleanly automates end-to-end processing of TESS light curve data based on user-defined transit parameters. I designed it to streamline high-volume photometric analysis, support custom model integration, and output analysis-ready datasets â€” making detailed work faster, scalable, and more consistent.

To open and properly run this pipeline:

1) mm
2) m
