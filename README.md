# photometric-pipeline
I built a clean Python tool that automates end-to-end processing of TESS light curve data based on user-defined transit parameters. I designed it to streamline high-volume photometric analysis, support custom model integration, and output analysis-ready datasets for precision-driven applications.

To open and properly run this pipeline:

1) mm
2) m
